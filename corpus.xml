          Edited by <ref target="https://lehkost.github.io/">Frank Fischer</ref>. This corpus
          contains all 37 of Shakespeare's plays in their German translations published by Schlegel
          and Tieck, in the edition of Aufbau-Verlag Berlin/Weimar (3rd edition 1975), which is based
          on the last edition published during Schlegel's lifetime (3rd edition 1843/44). The
          digitised print edition was procured from <ref
            target="http://www.zeno.org/nid/20005683920">Zeno.org</ref> (via TextGrid Repository),
          which also provided an additional play (»Die beiden edlen Vettern«) that Shakespeare is
          now considered to have co-authored. This is a first beta version of the corpus. For a full
          description please see the <ref target="https://github.com/dracor-org/gershdracor">README
            on GitHub</ref>.
