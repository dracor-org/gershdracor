**Ger**man **Sh**akespeare **Dra**ma **Cor**pus. Edited by [Frank Fischer](https://lehkost.github.io/). This TEI-encoded corpus contains all 37 of Shakespeare's plays in their German translations published by Schlegel and Tieck, in the edition of Aufbau-Verlag Berlin/Weimar (3rd edition 1975), which is based on the last edition published during Schlegel's lifetime (3rd edition 1843/44). The digitised print edition was procured from [Zeno.org](http://www.zeno.org/nid/20005683920) (via TextGrid Repository), which also provided an additional play (»Die beiden edlen Vettern«) that Shakespeare is now considered to have co-authored. We have made many adjustments and enhancements that will be documented in more detail. This is the first beta version of the corpus.

More info soon.
